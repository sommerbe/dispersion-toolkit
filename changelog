* compatibility break: stat-confidence pushes mean stats as final point (not separate point set anymore) after possible confidence values (as points)
* compatibility break: renamed procedure vis-psspy.py to vis-pss.py
* extension: vis-psspy reads point set's domain boundary (previously only [0,1]^2)
* extension: stat-confidence handles stacked graphs
* extension: point set has new header to store arguments (#arg ...)
* fixes: write-matrix spurious point delimiter after last point
* fixes: stat-confidence infers statistics domain from point set domain
* fixes: clearing a point set implicitly clears its domain boundary (since number of dimensions are cleared already)

# 1.3.0

* extension: supporting Mathematica's matrix format for both read-matrix and write-matrix (thanks to Thomas Lachmann)
* extension: visualising point sets may read directly from files, besides std in
* extension: new visualisation: rectangles (vis-rectangles.py) (thanks to the suggestion by Thomans Lachmann)
* extension: procedure disp-combinatorial accepts new options: [--box-area] [--no-box-coordinates] [--box-area-min=BINARY64] [--box-area-max=BINARY64]
* extension: visualisation of rectangles works with empty sets within the sequence, and now accepts the specification of the problem domain as well as the number of grid lines to draw
* extension: procedure disp-gs now accepts high dimensional point sets
* code quality: moving manpages into distinct repository
* parallelised: procedure disp-gs using OpenMP (if available)
* parallelised: procedure disp-combinatorial using OpenMP (if available)
* parallelised: procedure disp-dumitrescu2017
* parallelised: procedure disp-naamad
* parallelised: procedure pdisp-permute
* fixes: readme: resulting filenames of an image sequence
* fixes: MSVC 19 build errors and warnings [issue #1] (thanks to Thomas Lachmann)
* fixes: installation directive concerning vis/psspy
* fixes: help of pdisp-permute

# 1.2.0 

* adding script: package.sh <version> <directory>
* new program: pdisp-permute
* fixes: missing delete* if file open fails
* fixes: aborts program forcefully if input file can not be opened
* fixes: compile error on non-UNIX machines (thanks to Thomas Lachmann)

# 1.1.0

* new program: writematrix
* pointset reader may implicitly assume matrix input (no error without #eos)

# 1.0.0

* initial release
