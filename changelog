* extension: vis-psspy reads point set's domain boundary (previously only [0,1]^2)
* fixes: write-matrix spurious point delimiter after last point
* fixes: stat-confidence infers statistics domain from point set domain
* extension: stat-confidence handles stacked graphs
* compatibility break: stat-confidence pushes mean stats as final point (not separate point set anymore) after possible confidence values (as points)

# 1.3.0

* fixes readme: resulting filenames of an image sequence
* moving manpages into distinct repository
* fixes MSVC 19 build errors and warnings [issue #1] (thanks to Thomas Lachmann)
* supporting Mathematica's matrix format for both read-matrix and write-matrix (thanks to Thomas Lachmann)
* visualising point sets may read directly from files, besides std in
* fixes installation directive concerning vis/psspy
* new visualisation: rectangles (vis-rectangles.py) (thanks to the suggestion by Thomans Lachmann)
* parallelised procedure disp-combinatorial using OpenMP (if available)
* procedure disp-combinatorial accepts new options: [--box-area] [--no-box-coordinates] [--box-area-min=BINARY64] [--box-area-max=BINARY64]
* visualisation of rectangles works with empty sets within the sequence, and now accepts the specification of the problem domain as well as the number of grid lines to draw
* parallelised procedure disp-gs using OpenMP (if available)
* procedure disp-gs now accepts high dimensional point sets
* fixes help of pdisp-permute
* parallelised procedure disp-dumitrescu2017
* parallelised procedure disp-naamad
* parallelised procedure pdisp-permute

# 1.2.0 

* adding script: package.sh <version> <directory>
* new program: pdisp-permute
* fixes: missing delete* if file open fails
* fixes: aborts program forcefully if input file can not be opened
* fixes: compile error on non-UNIX machines (thanks to Thomas Lachmann)

# 1.1.0
