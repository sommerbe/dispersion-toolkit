## compatibility break 
* stat-confidence pushes mean stats as final point (not separate point set anymore) after possible confidence values (as points)
* renamed procedure vis-psspy.py to vis-pss.py

## extensions
* vis-psspy reads point set's domain boundary (previously only [0,1]^2)
* stat-confidence handles stacked graphs
* point set has new header to store arguments (#arg ...)
* new header (#domain ...) of point sets replaces (#d ...) for readability
* disp-combinatorial may stream graphs (--graph-layout)
* disp-naamad may stream graphs (--graph-layout)

## fixes
* write-matrix spurious point delimiter after last point
* stat-confidence infers statistics domain from point set domain
* clearing a point set implicitly clears its domain boundary (since number of dimensions are cleared already)

# 1.3.0

## extensions
* supporting Mathematica's matrix format for both read-matrix and write-matrix (thanks to Thomas Lachmann)
* visualising point sets may read directly from files, besides std in
* new visualisation: rectangles (vis-rectangles.py) (thanks to the suggestion by Thomans Lachmann)
* procedure disp-combinatorial accepts new options: [--box-area] [--no-box-coordinates] [--box-area-min=BINARY64] [--box-area-max=BINARY64]
* visualisation of rectangles works with empty sets within the sequence, and now accepts the specification of the problem domain as well as the number of grid lines to draw
* procedure disp-gs now accepts high dimensional point sets

## code quality
* moving manpages into distinct repository

## parallelisation
* procedure disp-gs using OpenMP (if available)
* procedure disp-combinatorial using OpenMP (if available)
* procedure disp-dumitrescu2017
* procedure disp-naamad
* procedure pdisp-permute

## fixes
* readme: resulting filenames of an image sequence
* MSVC 19 build errors and warnings [issue #1] (thanks to Thomas Lachmann)
* installation directive concerning vis/psspy
* help of pdisp-permute


# 1.2.0 

## extensions
* adding script: package.sh <version> <directory>
* new program: pdisp-permute

## fixes
* missing delete* if file open fails
* aborts program forcefully if input file can not be opened
* compile error on non-UNIX machines (thanks to Thomas Lachmann)

# 1.1.0

* new program: writematrix
* pointset reader may implicitly assume matrix input (no error without #eos)

# 1.0.0

* initial release
